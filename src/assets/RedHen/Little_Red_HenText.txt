Once upon a time there was a little red hen who lived on a farm. /n 
Early one morning she woke up and went outside. There she found some corn. /n 
“Who will help me plant the corn?” said the little red hen. /n 
“Not I,” said the bull. /n 
“Not I,” said the cat. /n 
“Not I,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh very well, I’ll do it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did! /n 
“Who will help me water the corn?” said the little red hen. /n 
“Not I,” said the bull. /n 
“Not I,” said the cat. /n 
“Not I,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh very well, I’ll do it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did! /n 
“Who will help me cut the corn?” said the little red hen. /n 
“Not I,” said the bull. /n 
“Not I,” said the cat. /n 
“Not I,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh very well, I’ll do it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did! /n 
“Who will help me carry the corn to the mill?” said the little red hen. /n 
“Not I,” said the bull. /n 
“Not I,” said the cat. /n 
“Not I,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh very well, I’ll do it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did! /n 
“Who will help me grind the corn?” said the little red hen. /n 
“Not I,” said the bull. /n 
“Not I,” said the cat. /n 
“Not I,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh very well, I’ll do it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did! /n 
“Who will help me knead the bread?” said the little red hen. /n 
“Not I,” said the bull. /n 
“Not I,” said the cat. /n 
“Not I,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh very well, I’ll do it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did! /n 
“Who will help me bake the bread?” said the little red hen. /n 
“Not I,” said the bull. /n 
“Not I,” said the cat. /n 
“Not I,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh very well, I’ll do it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did! /n 
“Who will help me eat the bread?” said the little red hen. /n 
“I will,” said the bull. /n 
“I will,” said the cat. /n 
“I will,” said the rat. /n 
“Oh no you won’t. I’ll eat it myself,” said the little red hen – and so she did!
